process table to determine value

sort by value and distance



each entity type has a table for what they get from other entities
entities can obtain resources, resources convert to value depending on how much the entity needs those resources
entities can also obtain value even if they dont get any resources, if they dislike them by design or if they grew to dislike them



change decisionmaking to come from analysis of all nearby objects, sorting by percieved benefit of executing, for food the benefit is the energy worth of food minus some weighted distance to the food

increase resolution to make text smaller, scale up tiles
remove destination for gnome's goals, wasn't used anyway
