make collision between mobs at least or even try a_star again??

make idling be more worth than very far away goals
test multiple mob factions interacting

herbivores vs omnivores too


------------------------------------------

add bananas/tree lists, change respawning to choose randomly from those lists
make resource respawn rate exponential relative to resource count
disable homes for now
reproduction - exponential as well, can change upper cap if stabilized at or below
track timers for below 50% of max, if below 50% of max for a long time, reduce max cap
add reproduction growth modifier
