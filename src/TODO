think about the prioritizing by distance thing, might prune results too much

think about stuff for mobs to do other than eating

should add monster mobs to kill ala dota creeps, gnomes can decide to go on an adventure to kill them

implement mobs interacting with entities non-destructively, for example conversations that boost or decrease mutual disposition or looking at things etc

maybe make entity hp be a resource in the values map as well

maybe make a map for mobs of values like hp, energy, etc


------------------------------------------

tone down reproduction for now
remove error checking for non-existent mob lists
add mob personal names
add randomization to goal selection, now all goals have a chance to be selected, higher score goals are selected most often
