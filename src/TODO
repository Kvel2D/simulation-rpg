think about stuff for mobs to do other than eating

should add monster mobs to kill ala dota creeps, gnomes can decide to go on an adventure to kill them, something that a big dragon that doesn't do much other than attack anyone who attacks it

implement mobs interacting with entities non-destructively, for example conversations that boost or decrease mutual disposition or looking at things etc

need to change the way resources respawn
they can't ever get completely consumed
but they also shouldn't respawn non-stop
there should be potential for drama like a faction outgrowing nearby resource stores and having to conquer new lands

------------------------------------------

add a couple of null checks
combine mob variable initialization, add error checks
change goal value calculation to use weights instead of conditions
make resource respawn use same lists as mobs, separate resources by string keys
