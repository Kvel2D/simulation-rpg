separate bananas and wood for npc decisionmaking, make npcs gather wood only when they need it


fix resolution, upscale graphics
change gathering to be part of the "goal" system, goals should cover all possible npc actions: moving somewhere, gathering a resource, killing an enemy(maybe gathering and killing is the same thing)
change decisionmaking to come from analysis of all nearby objects, sorting by percieved benefit of executing, for food the benefit is the energy worth of food minus some weighted distance to the food
doesn't have to be completely mathematically accurate, can be arbitrary where gnomes sometimes make unoptimal decisions



------------------------------------------

change random_move to not modify moves array, yikes...
info about entities on hover
change plant spawning to not spawn on top of other entities
add free_map of free spaces, add free_map modification on spawning/moving of entities
make gathering take up one state in state machine
